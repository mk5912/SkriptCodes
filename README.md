# This repository will contain all my [Skript](https://www.skunity.com/downloads) codes. 
## Here is a direct download link for [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases/download/2.6/Skript.jar)!\

### So far this repository contains only 4 of my codes but I will be adding more shortly!
### All the code that are not in the experimental directory, although work, are still incomplete and may rely on other scripts or spigot plugins to function correctly, one such example is the powerBungee.sk script which relies on [Skungee](https://www.github.com/Skungee/Skungee-2.0.0/releases) and my [server start script](https://www.github.com/mk5912/SpigotServerCodes).
